# Inspectra-Gadget
Inspectra-Gadget is a GUI for inspecting and post-processing quantum transport data (e.g. differential conductance spectra) originally made by Joeri De Bruijckere. You can find the original version here: https://github.com/joeridebruijckere/Inspectra-Gadget

The elab version adds compatibility with datasets generated from qcodes-elab (https://github.com/djcarrad/qcodes-elab) and adds additional functionality.
